# AVR_Programming
A repository containing programs for the various features in the AVR(ATMEGA 16) microcontroller. 

This repository has been re-created from an old repository in my previous Github account.
All these codes were previously written in a modified manner for my robotics projects as a part of the Robotics And Machine Intelligence(RMI) club of NIT Trichy.
I am migrating the codes to my university github account to incorporate the latest course projects as well.
